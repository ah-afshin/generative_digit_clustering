# Unsupervised Digit Clustering

This project explores different autoencoder architectures to learn meaningful compressed representations of handwritten digit images (MNIST dataset). These representations are used for clustering and generating new digit images.

## Components

- `models.py` â€“ Definitions of various autoencoder models.
- `train_autoencoder.py` â€“ Training loop for learning image compression and reconstruction.
- `visualize.py` â€“ Visualizes reconstructed images after encoding and decoding.
- `clustering.py` â€“ Applies clustering on compressed features and generates new images from clusters using decoder.

This project was created for learning purposes. Iâ€™ve tried to write clear and well-documented code.
